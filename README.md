This program was created for a Software Engineer Test at FetchRewards. It will check if a given word is a Pyramid word 
or not. e.g.

>BANANA is a pyramid word where 'B' occurs 1 time, 'N' occurs 2 times, 'A' occurs 3 times (1,2,3)
>BANDANA is a not pyramid word as 'B' occurs 1 time, 'D' occurs 1 time, 'N' occurs 2 times, 'A' occurs 3 times (1,1,2,3)

To test, run as a spring boot app and then run the following commands in the terminal
>curl localhost:8080/pyramid/<TEST_STRING_HERE>
